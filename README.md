# hello-world
This is the first time I am making a repository! It kind of sounds like a suppository but way less invasive!
I have never taken a suppository so I'm sorry I mentioned that. Anyway, my name is Abby and I am taking Introduction to Informatics. Coding and computers scare me, but I'm here for it all. I am about to graduate in 6 weeks! Yay!
